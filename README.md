An individual project for Student Originated Software at The Evergreen State College

This is a project that is intended to help me learn webscraping.
This repository includes both the major project itself as well as excercises I've found online and small tests I've ran.
This is not a showcase of my development habits as commits to this repository are sparse, but it is a place for me to look back at what I've done.
