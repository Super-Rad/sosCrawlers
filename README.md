# sosCrawlers
##An individual project for Student Originated Software at The Evergreen State College

This project has undergone several massive changes. As the scope and intention has continued to evolve over time.

##Current Structure:

###indeedCrawler
This is a finished version of my webcrawler built for indeed.com

###samples
An assortment of things I built during the course of the project. Some are straight from tutorials I followed; others are experiments I ran. Not all of them work, and this is by no means a complete collection of things I worked on. It is meant to be a sampling of some of the things I did.

###sos_scraping
This is my indeedCrawler packaged in an official fashion. The structure of this directory is based on an essay by Kenneth Reitz, a fellow at Python. This file currently has no tracked information.

###wkspc
This is the directory where I have been using virtualenv to do all of the work related to this project.
